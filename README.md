## Student Exam Performance Indicator
Welcome to the Student Exam Performance Indicator project! This is an end-to-end machine learning application that predicts student performance in exams based on various factors. The goal of this project is to provide valuable insights and support educational interventions to improve academic outcomes.

## Dataset 

The dataset used for this project is the "Student Performance" dataset, which contains information about students' demographics, parental education, test preparation, and exam scores. The dataset is available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams

Parental Level of Education: Categorical variable indicating the highest level of education attained by the student's parents
Type of Lunch: Categorical variable indicating the type of lunch the student receives (standard or free/reduced)
Test Preparation Course: Binary variable indicating whether the student completed a test preparation course
reading_score : inteager in the range of 0 and 100 
writing score : inteager in the range of 0 and 100
